# Basic-Python
This repository would be my journey of what I have learnt from the Galvanise training programme.

## Interpreted vs Compiled coding languages
Interpreted languages such as python and R, consists of coding languages which execute code line by line, and if any error is found in the code, the program will crash and will not continue running your code.

Compiled languages, on the other hand, is used to create code which is translated into a machine code. Additionally, after writing code, a compilation of more than one piece of code is needed for the running of the compiled code, to see whether the program will run or bug during its use. 

Compiled code essentially need to run more than one source of code at a time to work and/or to be tested successfully. Unlike the interpreted coding language which simply relies on one coding document.

Here is a video which might explain it better than I might do:

## Text Editors
Basically never use word processors for coding "unless you are quite forced to do so, like in a Google job interview".

## Python documentation and resources
Google all the way, whatever queries you might have, you might find a solution in a website called stack overflow.

## Casting
Transforming one data type into another data type. Anyways, most of what I have practised is in the main.py
